          <p>
            This site displays a prototype of a “Web 2.0” version of the daily
            Federal Register. It is not an official legal edition of the Federal
            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official
            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.
          </p>

          <p>
            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal
            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the
            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the
            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial
            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal
            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.
            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications
            and services, go to
            <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/the-federal-register/about.html" title="About the Federal Register">
              About the Federal Register
            </a>
             on NARA's archives.gov.
          </p>

          <p>
            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable
            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of
            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned
            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that
            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with
            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for
            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of
            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML
            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not
            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.

                <h2 id="h-8">Background</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="42409">HHS is publishing this rule to comply with a requirement of the Defense Production Act Reauthorization of 2009 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/67" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-67</a>) (the &ldquo;DPAR&rdquo;). The Defense Production Act Reauthorization of 2009 required that HHS, and all other agencies that previously have been delegated authority to issue rated orders under <a href="/executive-order/13603" class="eo">Executive Order 13603</a>, publish regulations providing standards and procedures for prioritization of contracts and orders and for allocation of materials, services, and facilities to promote the national defense under both emergency and non-emergency conditions. HHS's regulation, along with regulations promulgated by other agencies, will become part of the Federal Priorities and Allocations System.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="42409">The HRPAS is part of the Federal Priorities and Allocations System. The HRPAS has two principal components: priorities and allocations. Under the priorities component, certain contracts between the government and private parties or between private parties for the production or delivery of industrial resources are required to be given priority over other contracts to facilitate expedited delivery in promotion of the U.S. national defense. Under the allocations component, materials, services, and facilities may be allocated to promote the national defense. For both components, the term &ldquo;national defense&rdquo;' is defined broadly and can include critical infrastructure protection and restoration, emergency preparedness and response, and recovery from natural and man-made disasters. Priorities authorities (and other authorities delegated to the Secretary in <a href="/executive-order/13603" class="eo">E.O. 13603</a>, but not covered by this regulation) may be re-delegated by the Secretary. The Secretary retains the authority for allocations.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="42409">On September 30, 2009, Congress amended the DPA through the Defense Production Act Reauthorization of 2009 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/67" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-67</a>) (the &ldquo;DPAR&rdquo;). The DPAR directed, all agencies to which the President has delegated priorities and allocations authority under <a href="/executive-order/13603" class="eo">E.O. 13603</a>, publish final rules establishing standards and procedures by which that authority will be used to promote the national defense in both emergency and nonemergency situations. The DPAR also required all such agencies to consult as appropriate and to the extent practicable to develop a consistent and unified Federal priorities and allocations system. This rule is one of several rules to be published to implement the provisions of the DPAR. The final rules of the agencies with DPAR authorities, which are the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Defense, and Agriculture, will comprise the Federal Priorities and Allocations System (&ldquo;FPAS&rdquo;). HHS is publishing this interim final rule in compliance with the provision of the DPAR noted above. HHS's HRPAS provisions are consistent with the FPAS regulations being issued by other agencies. The specific proposals in this rule are more fully described below.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">Analysis of the Priorities and Allocations System</h2>
                <h2 id="h-10">General</h2>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="42409">Section 101.1 states the purpose of the HRPAS in general terms, as providing guidance and procedures for use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) priorities and allocations authority with respect to health resources necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="42409">Section 101.2 provides guidance and procedures for the use of the DPA priorities and allocation authority with respect to health resources necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="42409">Section 101.3 provides an overview of the HRPAS program eligibility. </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="42409">This section describes briefly aspects of the HRPAS, including the certain programs for military and health resources under the DPA.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">Definitions</h2>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="42409">The &ldquo;Definitions&rdquo; section appears in &sect;&thinsp;101.20 and provides definitions for the relevant regulatory terms.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">Placement of Rated Orders</h2>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="42409">Section 101.30, &ldquo;Delegation of Authority,&rdquo; describes fully the President's delegations to HHS. It also describes, in general terms, the items subject to HHS's jurisdiction. This provision facilitates public understanding of the role that each delegate agency plays in the overall priorities and allocations system.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="42409">Section 101.31, &ldquo;Priority ratings,&rdquo; describes the two possible levels of priority and program identification symbols used when rating an order.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="42409">Section 101.32, &ldquo;Elements of a rated order,&rdquo; describes in detail what each rated order must include, consisting of the appropriate priority rating, delivery date information, signatures and required language. HHS seeks comment specifically on the text of this provision.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="42409">Section 101.33, &ldquo;Acceptance and rejection of rated orders,&rdquo; details when orders placed by HHS may or must be accepted or rejected, and what the procedures are for both, including customer notification requirements and certain exceptions for emergency preparedness conditions. Specifically, persons must accept or reject rated orders for emergency response-related approved programs within fifteen (15) working days (or ten (10) working days, depending on the circumstance). HHS requires the shorter time limit in for the recipient to respond to a rated order issued in connection with an emergency response because such orders would require a shorter time frame to ensure delivery in time to provide disaster assistance, emergency response or similar activities. HHS believes that the exigent circumstances inherent in such activities justify requiring a shorter response time.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="42409">Section 101.34, &ldquo;Preferential scheduling,&rdquo; details procedures in cases where a person receives two or more conflicting rated orders. If a person is unable to resolve such a conflict, this section refers them to special priorities assistance as provided in &sect;&sect;&thinsp;101.40 through 101.44.</p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="42409">Section 101.35, &ldquo;Extension of priority ratings,&rdquo; requires a person to use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items or services needed to fill a rated order. This allows the priority rating to &ldquo;extend&rdquo; from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.</p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="42409">Section 101.36, &ldquo;Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders,&rdquo; provides procedures for changing or cancelling a rated order, both by HHS or other persons who placed the order.</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="42409">Section 101.37, &ldquo;Use of rated orders,&rdquo; lists what items must be rated. It also introduces the use of certain program identification symbols used when rated orders may be combined, and details the procedures for combining two or more rated orders, as well as rated and unrated orders.</p>

                    Section 101.38, &ldquo;Limitations on placing rated orders,&rdquo; prohibits the use of rated orders in a list of specific circumstances. This section also

                <p id="p-29" data-page="42410">Section 101.40, &ldquo;General provisions&rdquo; illustrates when and how HHS can provide special priorities assistance, and provides specific HHS points of contact and the form to be used for requesting such assistance. Special priorities assistance may generally be requested for any reason.</p>
                <p id="p-30" data-page="42410">Section 101.41, &ldquo;Requests for priority rating authority,&rdquo; directs persons to the Department of Commerce to request rating authority for production or construction equipment. This section also identifies circumstances in which HHS may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract, and lists factors HHS will consider in deciding whether to grant this authority.</p>
                <p id="p-31" data-page="42410">Section 101.42, &ldquo;Examples of assistance,&rdquo; provides a number of examples of when special priorities assistance may be provided, although it may generally be provided for any reason.</p>

                     to secure a price advantage).
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-14">Allocation Actions</h2>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="42410">Sections 101.50 through 101.52 describe allocations and contain procedures for the use of allocation orders. Specifically, allocation orders will be used only if priorities authority will not provide a sufficient supply of material, services or facilities for national defense requirements, or when use of priorities authority will cause a severe and prolonged disruption in the supply of resources available to support normal U.S. economic activities. Allocation orders will not be used to ration materials or services at the retail level. Allocation orders will be distributed equitably among the suppliers of the resource(s) being allocated and will not require any person to relinquish a disproportionate share of the civilian market. The standards set forth in &sect;&sect;&thinsp;101.50 through 101.52 provide reasonable assurance that allocation orders will be used only in situations where the circumstances justify such orders.</p>
                <p id="p-34" data-page="42410">Section 101.53 describes the three types of allocation orders that HHS might issue. The types of allocation orders are a set-aside, an allocation directive, and an allotment. A set-aside is an official action that will require a person to reserve resource capacity in anticipation of receipt of rated orders. An allocation directive is an official action that will require a person to take or refrain from taking certain actions in accordance with its provisions (an allocation directive can require a person to stop or reduce production of an item, prohibit the use of selected items, divert supply of one type of product to another, or to supply a specific quantity, size, shape, and type of an item within a specific time period). An allotment is an official action that will specify the maximum quantity of an item authorized for use in a specific program or application. HHS is requiring these three types of allocation orders because it believes that, collectively, they describe the types of actions that might be taken in any situation in which allocation is justified.</p>
                <p id="p-35" data-page="42410">Section 101.54, &ldquo;Elements of an allocation order,&rdquo; sets forth the minimum elements of an allocation order. Those elements are:</p>
                
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-36" data-page="42410">A detailed description of the required allocation action(s);</li>
                <li id="p-37" data-page="42410">Specific start and end calendar dates for each required allocation action;</li>
                <li id="p-38" data-page="42410">The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his/her designee, which certifies that the order is authorized under this regulation and that the order is consistent with requirements of the regulation;</li>
                <li id="p-39" data-page="42410">A statement that reads in substance:<em>This is an allocation order certified for national defense use. [Insert the legal name of the person receiving the order] is required to comply with this order, in accordance with the provisions of the Health Resources Priorities and Allocations System regulation (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-101.1" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45 CFR 101.1</a>), which is part of the Federal Priorities and Allocations System;</em>

                <p id="p-41" data-page="42410">HHS rquires these elements because it believes that they provide a proper balance between the need for standards to permit the public to recognize and understand an allocation order if one is issued, and the expectation that any actual allocation orders will have to be tailored to meet unforeseeable circumstances. The language of &sect;&thinsp;101.54 precludes HHS from including additional information in an allocation order if circumstances warrant doing so.</p>
                <p id="p-42" data-page="42410">Section 101.55, &ldquo;Mandatory acceptance of allocation orders,&rdquo; requires that an allocation order must be accepted if a person is capable of fulfilling the order. If a person is unable to comply fully with the required actions specific in an allocation order, the person must notify HHS immediately, explain the extent to which compliance is possible, and give reasons why full compliance is not possible. This section also states that a person may not discriminate against an allocation order in any manner, such as by charging higher prices or imposing terms and conditions different than what the person imposed on contracts or orders for the same resource(s) that were received prior to receiving the allocation order. Section 101.55 makes it clear to the public that the limited circumstances and emergency situations that trigger issuance of an allocation order require immediate response from the public in order to address the situation in an expedient fashion.</p>
                <p id="p-43" data-page="42410">Section 101.56, &ldquo;Changes or cancellations of an allocation order&rdquo; provides that an allocation order may be changed or cancelled by HHS.</p>

</h3>
                <p id="p-59" data-page="42411">HHS has examined the impacts of the interim final rule under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a> and <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">Executive Order 13563</a>. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). This rule is not an economically significant regulatory action under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-60" data-page="42411">A summary of the cost benefit analysis is provided below.</p>
                <p id="p-61" data-page="42411">This rule sets criteria under which HHS (or agencies to which HHS delegates HHS's DPA authority to issue rated orders) will authorize prioritization of certain orders or contracts as well as criteria under which HHS will issue orders allocating resources or production facilities. To date, HHS has minimally exercised its prioritization authority for contracts during the response to H1N1 influenza in 2009 to order ancillary supplies in support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Immunization Program, and not exercised its existing allocations authority.</p>
                <p id="p-62" data-page="42411">Under prioritization, HHS or its Delegate Agency designates certain orders as one of two possible priority levels. Once so designated, such orders are referred to as &ldquo;rated orders.&rdquo; The recipient of a rated order must give it priority over an unrated order or an order with a lower priority rating. A recipient of a rated order may place orders at the same priority level with suppliers and subcontractors for supplies and services necessary to fulfill the recipient's rated order and the suppliers and subcontractors must treat the request from the rated order recipient as a rated order with the same priority level as the original rated order. The rule does not require recipients to fulfill rated orders if the price or terms of sale are not consistent with the price or terms of sale of similar non-rated orders. The rule provides a defense from any liability for damages or penalties for actions taken in or inactions required for, compliance with the rule.</p>
                <p id="p-63" data-page="42411">The impact of HRPAS on private companies receiving priority orders is expected to vary. However, in most cases, there is likely to be no economic impact in filling priority orders because it will generally just be changing the timing in which orders are completed.</p>
                <p id="p-64" data-page="42411">HRPAS is expected to have an overall positive impact on the U.S. public and industry by maintaining and restoring the production, processing, storage, and distribution of health resources during times of both emergency and nonemergency conditions to promote national defense and to prevent civilian hardship in the food marketplace. While HHS has not yet administered HRPAS under DPA authority, the continued use of DPAS by the Department of Defense proves the utility of a priorities and allocations system.</p>
                <h3 id="h-20">B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</h3>
                <p id="p-65" data-page="42411">
                    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) requires preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HHS reviewed this interim final rule under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and has determined that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-21">Number of Small Entities</h2>
                <p id="p-66" data-page="42411">Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions. For purposes of assessing the impacts of this interim final rule on small entities, a small business, as described in the Small Business Administration's Table of Small Business Size Standards Matched to North American Industry Classification System Codes (January 2012 Edition), has a maximum annual revenue of $33.5 million and a maximum of 1,500 employees (for some business categories, these number are lower). A small governmental jurisdiction is a government of a city, town, school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000. A small organization is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.</p>
                <p id="p-67" data-page="42411">
                    This rule sets criteria under which HHS (or agencies to which HHS delegates HHS's DPA authority to issue rated orders) will authorize prioritization of certain orders or contracts as well as criteria under which HHS will issue orders allocating resources or production facilities. Because the rule affects commercial transactions, HHS believes that small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions are unlikely to be affected by this rule. To date, HHS has 
                    <span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="42412"><svg class="svg-icon svg-icon-doc-generic"><use xlink:href="/assets/fr-icons.svg#doc-generic"></use></svg></span><span class="printed-page-details unprinted-element document-markup" id="page-42412" data-page="42412"><svg class="svg-icon svg-icon-doc-generic"><use xlink:href="/assets/fr-icons.svg#doc-generic"></use></svg></span>
                    minimally exercised its prioritization authority for contracts during the response to 2009 H1N1 influenza to order ancillary supplies in support of HHS/CDC's Immunization Program, and not exercised its existing allocations authority. As such, HHS has no basis on which to estimate the number of small businesses that may be affected by this rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-22">Impact</h2>
                <p id="p-68" data-page="42412">The interim final rule has two principle components: prioritization and allocation. Under prioritization, HHS, or its Delegate Agency, designates certain orders as one of two possible priority levels. Once so designated, such orders are referred to as &ldquo;rated orders.&rdquo; The recipient of a rated order must give it priority over an unrated order or an order with a lower priority rating. A recipient of a rated order may place orders at the same priority level with suppliers and subcontractors for supplies and services necessary to fulfill the recipient's rated order and the suppliers and subcontractors must treat the request from the rated order recipient as a rated order with the same priority level as the original rated order. The rule does not require recipients to fulfill rated orders if the price or terms of sale are not consistent with the price or terms of sale of similar non-rated orders. The rule provides a defense from any liability for damages or penalties for actions taken in or inactions required for, compliance with the rule.</p>
                <p id="p-69" data-page="42412">Although rated orders could require a firm to fill one order prior to filling another, they will not necessarily require a reduction in the total volume of orders. The regulations will also not require the recipient of a rated order to reduce prices or provide rated orders with more favorable terms than a similar non-rated order. Under these circumstances, the economic effects on the rated order recipient of substituting one order for another are likely to be mutually offsetting, resulting in no net economic impact.</p>
                <p id="p-70" data-page="42412">Allocations could be used to control the general distribution of materials or services in the civilian market. Specific allocation actions that HHS might take are as follows:</p>
                <p id="p-71" data-page="42412">Set-aside: an official action that requires a person to reserve resource capacity in anticipation of receipt of rated orders.</p>
                <p id="p-72" data-page="42412">Allocations directive: an official action that requires a person to take or refrain from taking certain actions in accordance with its provisions. An allocation directive can require a person to stop or reduce production of an item, prohibit the use of selected items, or divert supply of one type of product to another, or to supply a specific quantity, size, shape, and type of an item within a specific time period.</p>
                <p id="p-73" data-page="42412">Allotment: an official action that specifies the maximum quantity of an item authorized for use in a specific program or application.</p>
                <p id="p-74" data-page="42412">
                    HHS has not yet taken any actions under its existing allocations authority, and any future allocations actions would be used only in extraordinary circumstances. As required by section 101(b) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, (50 U.S.C. App. Sec. 2071), hereinafter &ldquo;DPA,&rdquo; and by Section 201(a) (3) of <a href="/executive-order/13603" class="eo">Executive Order 13603</a>, HHS may implement allocations only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes, and the President approves, and determines that there is a scarcity of critical materials and services essential to the national defense, and that the requirements of the national defense cannot otherwise be met without a significant interruption of normal distribution of these essential materials or services in the civilian marketplace that would cause considerable hardship. &ldquo;National defense&rdquo; covers programs for military and health resources production or construction, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, homeland security, stockpiling, space, and any related activity. Such term includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/5195" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 U.S.C. 5195</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) and critical infrastructure protection and restoration.
                </p>
                <p id="p-75" data-page="42412">Any allocation actions taken by HHS must assure that small business concerns shall be accorded, to the extent practicable; a fair share of the materials or services covered by the allocation action in proportion to the share received by small business concerns under normal conditions, giving such special consideration as may be possible to emerging business concerns, 50 U.S.C. App. Sec. 2151(e).</p>
                <h2 id="h-23">Conclusion</h2>
                <p id="p-76" data-page="42412">Although HHS cannot determine precisely the number of small entities that will be affected by this rule, HHS believes that the overall impact on such entities will not be significant. In most instances, rated contracts will be fulfilled in addition to other (unrated) contracts and, in some instances might actually increase the total amount of business of the firm that receives a rated contract.</p>
                <p id="p-77" data-page="42412">Because allocations can be imposed only after an agency determination confirmed by the President, and because HHS has not yet used its allocations authority that has existed since passage of the Defense Production Act in 1950, one can expect allocations will be ordered only in particular circumstances. Any allocation actions would also have to comply with Section 701(e) of DPA (50 U.S.C. app. 2151(e)), which provides that small business concerns be accorded, to the extent practicable, a fair share of the material, including services, in proportion to the share received by such business concerns under normal conditions, giving such special consideration as may be possible to emerging business concerns.</p>
                <p id="p-78" data-page="42412">Therefore, HHS believes that the requirement for a Presidential determination and the provisions of section 701 of the DPA indicate that any impact on small business will not be significant.</p>
                <p id="p-79" data-page="42412">Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services certifies that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</p>

                     HRPAS will efficiently place priority ratings on contracts or orders of health resources within its authority as specified in the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950, as amended, when necessary. Applicants (Government agencies or private individuals with a role in emergency preparedness, response, and recovery functions) will request authorization from HHS to place a rating on a contract for items to support national defense activities. Applicants must supply, at time of request, their name, location, contact information, items for which the applicant is requesting assistance on, quantity, and delivery date. Applicants can submit the request by mail or fax.

                                     (1) There are two levels of priority established by Federal Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols &ldquo;DO&rdquo; and &ldquo;DX&rdquo;.

Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)</p>

If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.
